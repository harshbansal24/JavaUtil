Write code to add, subtract, multiply, and divide given numbers?

operations performed should be
       int result = calc.calculate(5,6,Operator.ADD);
       result = calc.calculate(result,6,Operator.MULTIPLY);
       result = calc.calculate(result,1,Operator.SUBTRACT);
       result = calc.calculate(result,5,Operator.DIVIDE);
       
       
       
Approach 1: Procedural Programming
Approaches 2 – 4: Object Oriented Programming
Approach 5: Functional Programming (Java 8)
